# If you wish to customize this, you can comment the above include and uncomment the three lines below

# SSL certificates
#
# Be sure that the directory and files are owned by and/or readable by the
# Nginx user. Additionally, it is recommended that you do not use password protected
# certificates. The justification for this recommendation is that in order to
# start up the Nginx server the password will need to be typed in every time.
# This precludes automatic/automated web server restarts on boot or otherwise.
